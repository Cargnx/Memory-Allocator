# Basic Memory Allocator

I'm currently learning C especially how things work under the hood.
Since I want to learn and actually retain it, i want to start making small projects. In this case i wanted to get to know more about memory management.

## Future ideas

For future ideas i want more or less implement more functionality as i learn.
(I will add Address Sanitizer to learn more about testing my code and see for any bugs and such...).
Other than that..., i'm unsure what _Exactly_ to implement but eventually I will :)

### Usage

Im using Makefile so the usage is pretty easy:

- make => build files
- make run => run code
- make clean => clean build folder
- make rebuild => clean and rebuild (combined)
  ...
